# Leap Year Checker in C++

This C++ program checks whether a given year is a **leap year** or not.  

---

## How it Works
- A year is a leap year if:
  - It is divisible by 4 **and not divisible by 100**, OR  
  - It is divisible by 400

- The program takes a year as input and prints whether it is a leap year.

## Example Output
<br>
Enter a year: 2024
<br>
2024 is a Leap Year.
<br>

Enter a year: 2100
<br>
2100 is Not a Leap Year.
